      <p class="w3-opacity" style=color:white>Reasercher/Prototype designer</p>
      <p style=color:white>Hi, my name is Malik Waddy. I was the only student to be distinguished on the GMAS for geometry, I got a 105 in ancient history college class, and I have a great understanding of algebra. I also understand math, general, and I flew a plane in a program called TAAST (Tuskegee Airmen Aviation and STEM Training). Can’t forget that I got into SMASH. My core values that are important to me include knowledge, wisdom, and reason. They're important, because I’m always in the pursuit to be wiser than others, which includes knowledge and reason. I developed these core values due to my constant belittlement as a kid for being childish and angry. My goal is to become an artist, an astrophysicist, to play the piano, and to learn everything. They are Important to me because I want the next generation to easily do it. It is connected to my identity Is how I’m always striding towards knowledge, and college can help me gain more knowledge.</p>

      <p style=color:white>Reginald Kempson III is an aspiring Marine Biologist who wants to discover the many mysteries of the sea’s vast waters.
